# 🩺 RAG Medical Chatbot — AI-Powered Medical Q&A Assistant

A FastAPI application that provides **context-aware medical answers** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
Upload your **medical documents** (PDFs, reports, or research papers), and the chatbot retrieves relevant information before generating accurate, AI-powered responses.

This project integrates **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **HuggingFace LLM**, and **FastAPI** to deliver a fast and reliable medical Q&A experience.
